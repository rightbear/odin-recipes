        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This dessert is a twist on a classic cheesecake that is sure to impress your dinner guests. It uses Dolce (sweet) Gorgonzola PDO to create a soft,
             creamy texture light enough to elegantly end the meal after a starter of Bread and Tomato Soup with Spicy Gorgonzola and Basil,
             followed by Toad in the Hole with Gorgonzola and Traditional Cumberland Sausages.</p>
